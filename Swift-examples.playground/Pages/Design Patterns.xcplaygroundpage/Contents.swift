/// In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

/// A `design pattern `isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code.
/// It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations




// MARK: - Creational Patterns
/// These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
/// While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

// MARK: Abstract Factory
/// Creates an instance of several families of classes

// MARK: Builder
/// Separates object construction from its representation

// MARK: Factory Method
/// Creates an instance of several derived classes

// MARK: Object Pool
/// Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use

// MARK: Prototype
/// A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

// MARK: Singletone
/// A class of which only a single instance can exist




// MARK: - Structural Patterns
/// These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition.
/// Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.
/// Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

// MARK: Adapter
/// Match interfaces of different classes

// MARK: Bridge
/// Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

// MARK: Composite
/// A tree structure of simple and composite objects

// MARK: Decorator
/// Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

// MARK: Facade
/// A single class that represents an entire subsystem

// MARK: Flyweigth
/// A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

// MARK: Private class data
/// Restricts accessor/mutator access

// MARK: Proxy
/// An object representing another object




// MARK: - Behavioral Patterns
/// These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication.
/// Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

// MARK: Chain of resposibility
/// A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

// MARK: Command
/// Encapsulate a command request as an object

// MARK: Interpreter
/// A way to include language elements in a program

// MARK: Iterator
/// Sequentially access the elements of a collection

// MARK: Mediator
/// Defines simplified communication between classes

// MARK: Memento
/// Capture and restore an object's internal state

// MARK: Null Object
/// Designed to act as a default value of an object

// MARK: Observer
/// A way of notifying change to a number of classes

// MARK: State
/// Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

// MARK: Strategy
/// Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

// MARK: Template method
/// Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

// MARK: Visitor
/// Defines a new operation to a class without change
