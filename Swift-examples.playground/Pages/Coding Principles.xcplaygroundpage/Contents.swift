// MARK: - YAGNI: You Are Not Gonna Need It
/// Do not write the code - if you think it will be needed later

/// Especiallt during refactoring
/// Delete those codes, that are no longer needed. Even if they were used in the past.
/// If it will be need in the future, you can get from the git




// MARK: - DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
/// Duplicating a code - is waste of time and resource. You have to keep up to date code in several places at once
/// Duplication happens because of the lack of the knowledge about the system.
/// Before coding, it is better to research the system. May be the functionality is already implemented

/// This conept was described in the book "Программист-прагматик: путь от подмастерья к мастеру" by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas
/// It is about the `Single Source of Truth` (SSOT):
/// In information systems design and theory, a single source of truth (SSOT) is the practice of structuring information models and data schema,
/// which implies that all pieces of data are processed (or edited) in only one place... SSOTs provide reliable, relevant and usable data




// MARK: - KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
/// This principle states that simple systems are sfare and more reliable
/// Do not reinvent the wheel. Do not use new tool because they are new, but because they are appropriate




// MARK: - Big Design UP Front
/// Before starting implementation, make sure that everything is clear
/// Some coders might think that if you do not write code then you are not coder. It is better to think as Developer
/// Without planning, starting fromo scratch is about to happen several times
/// Early problem detection is better than adhoc solutions

/// A very common counter-argument is that the cost of solving problems is often less than the cost of planning time.
/// The fewer errors a user encounters, the better their experience will be. You may not have another chance to deal with these mistakes.
