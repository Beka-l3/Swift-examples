// MARK: - Semaphores

/// DispatchSemaphore gives us the ability to control access to a shared resource by multiple threads
/// DispatchSemaphore allows only one thread to access shared resources at a time.
/// And the order of uses of resources is (FIFO), who asks first get the resource first.
/// Semaphores contain threads queues and a counter value integer type

/// `Thread queue`: it is used to keep track of waiting threads in the queue in FIFO order

/// `Counter Value:` it is used to decide if a thread should get access to a shared resource or not.
/// The counter value changes when we call `signal()` or `wait()` function

/// wait() : This function calls each time before using the shared resource. the thread asks the semaphore if the shared resource is available or not. If not, the thread will wait.
/// - wait() function decrease semaphore counter by 1.
/// - If the result value is less than 0, the thread is frozen.
/// - If the result value is equal to or bigger than zero, the code will get executed without waiting

/// signal() : every time after using the shared resource. the function will signal the semaphore that threads are done interacting with the shared resource.
/// - signal() function increase semaphore counter by 1.
/// - If the previous result value was less than zero, this function wakes the oldest thread currently waiting in the thread queue.
/// - If the previous result value is equal to or bigger than zero, it means the thread queue is empty, no one is waiting.
