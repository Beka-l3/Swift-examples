/// Basic unit of information is ``bit`` = 1/0
/// Traditionally we orgonize them into groups called ``bytes``
/// `1 byte == 8 bits`

// Memory is a long sequence of bytes
/// They are located in a defined order
/// Every byte has it's own `address`

/// We consider memory as a organized ``words`` but not `bytes`
/// ``Word`` is a faded terminology in Computer Science, but usually this means unit of pointer size
/// Modern computers has 64-bit CPU.
/// So `1 word == 8 bytes == 64 bits`
/// ! That's the amount of information we get in one access to the memory
